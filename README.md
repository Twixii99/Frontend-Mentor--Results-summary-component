## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Live server

### Continued development

- Learning JS to add more dynamicity to the website, for example adding the summary items dynamically from the JSON file.
- Learning how to think on paper about the relations between the components of the design and then start coding.
  - think about when to use grid and flex.
  - when to use class selctor or attribue selector.
  - thinking about custom properties (css variables).
  - adding the starter code for my project before doing anything.

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8) - This helped me for redesigning my code to be cleaner and more elegant than it was, it also helped me to think before code the project. I finished the project before showing it but it had many repeated code with lots of bugs.
